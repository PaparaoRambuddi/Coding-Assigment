Can you implement the sing() method for the bird?

1 .How did you unit test it?
	Implemented unit tests for methods in Bird class.
	Refactored code to return String instead of printing the results in order to test easily.
	
	How did you optimize the code for maintainability?
	changed Animal class to an interface as there are no common methods needs to be abstracted and there is no current requirement to instantiate an object of class Animal.
